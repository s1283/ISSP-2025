            The Service includes the BrainTest test (the "Test"), which is a screening instrument for mild cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The Test is a scientifically validated, digital version of the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE®), which was created by doctors at the Ohio State University. Doctors at Ohio State University completed the validation study of the Test. We strive to ensure that any scientific claims related to the Test are based on current scientific evidence. However by using the Service and taking the Test you acknowledge and understand that future scientific developments and findings may affect the validation of the Test and the claims made in the Service, and that we therefore cannot guarantee the fitness or accuracy of the Test in the future should the underlying science evolve or otherwise change.
